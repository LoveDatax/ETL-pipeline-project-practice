# ETL-pipeline-project-practice
To practice building ETL pipeline for various industries 
I started working on the wine dataset, I previewed the dataset so I knew how to go about making it a transformed file
Created a seperate .py script containing the etl_pipeline functions and i tested it on the 150k wine data set and 130k v2 wine dataset
All was done using "Jupyter Notebook" from anaconda Navigator
Got the data from "Kaggle.com"
1stwine_etl_pipe was my first ever trial 
Got better with the seperate .py script i created for etl functions used in 2ndwine_etl_p_pipe
working on implementing a workflow with airflow
