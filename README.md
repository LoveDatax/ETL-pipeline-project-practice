# ETL-pipeline-project-practice

## Wine Data Pipeline
To practice building ETL pipeline for various industries 
I started working on the [wine dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews), I previewed the dataset so I knew how to go about making it a transformed file.

- Created a `seperate.py` script containing the `etl_pipeline` functions and I tested it on the 150k wine data set and 130k v2 wine dataset.
- All was done using `Jupyter Notebook` from Anaconda Navigator
- Got the data from [Kaggle.com](https://kaggle.com)
1stwine_etl_pipe was my first ever trial. 
- Got better with the seperate .py script i created for etl functions used in 2ndwine_etl_p_pipe
- Working on implementing a workflow with airflow
